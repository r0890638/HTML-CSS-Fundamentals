<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Talking about HTML, one needs to understand these vocabulary:
<ul>
<li> Elements </li>
<li> Tags </li>
<li> Attributes</li>
</ul>
<p> By the way, do you know about Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<!-- It would be great if I can also add images and links to this webpage. By the way, this is a comment on HTML, and you cannot see what I have written here in this "comment tag" -->
<p> Now let's add some photos on this webpage. To do so, we need to use <q>img</q> tag.</p>
<h4>While most of the HTML tags, which once opened <(tag)> needs to be closed with a forward slash "<(/tag)>", there are self closing tags. That means these tags do not need to be closed with a forward slash.</h4>
  <p>To insert an image, we use the <code>img</code> tag, which is a self-closing tag.
    For example: let us use this code, <code>img</code>.</p>
<p>The code <code>img</code> is a self-closing tag. </p>

 <xmp><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3VTKgE9.png" alt="Computer User">" alt=computer user""></xmp>-->
  <!-- P.S. XMP is deprecated, but I am using it deliberately. -->

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3VTKgE9.png" alt="Computer User" width=300>
<p>The image that you see here is by using the following code:
</p> 
  <p><&nbsp<strong>img src="https://i.imgur.com/3VTKgE9.png" alt="Computer User"></strong> Here <q>img</q> is a self-closing tag. While <q>alt</q> is an attribute that provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it, <q>width</q> is an attribute that specifies the width of the element, in pixels.</p>
