<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Talking about HTML, one needs to understand these vocabulary:
<ul>
<li> Elements </li>
<li> Tags </li>
<li> Attributes</li>
</ul>
<p> By the way, do you know about Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<p> Now let's add some photos on this webpage. To do so, we need to use <q>img</q> tag.</p>
<h4>While most of the HTML tags, which once opened <(tag)> needs to be closed with a forward slash "<(/tag)>", there are self closing tags. That means these tags do not need to be closed with a forward slash.</h4>
<p>Now let us put an image on our webpage.To insert an image, we use the <code>img</code> tag, which is a self-closing tag.
For example: let us use this code, <code>

<p>The code <code>img</code> is a self-closing tag. </p>
